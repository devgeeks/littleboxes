# littleboxes
The groundwork of a mobile css framework. Just the boxes.

### Rationale

After reading ["You Can't Not Have a Framework"](http://blog.ryanflorence.com/you-cant-not-have-a-framework.html) by [@ryanflorence](https://github.com/ryanflorence), I decided that I was not actually writing my apps without a CSS framework, so much as I was writing my own CSS framework but without any of the benefits of writing it purposefully.

This is an attempt to do so, at least for part of it.

The rest might come later, and elsewhere.
